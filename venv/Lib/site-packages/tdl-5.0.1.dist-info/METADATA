=======
 About
=======
This is a Python cffi_ port of libtcod_.

This library is `hosted on GitHub <https://github.com/HexDecimal/python-tdl>`_.

Any issues you have with this module can be reported at the
`GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/HexDecimal/python-tdl/issues>`_.

=======
 Usage
=======
This module was designed to be backward compatible with the original libtcodpy
module distributed with libtcod.
If you had code that runs on libtcodpy then you can use this library as a
drop-in replacement::

    import tcod as libtcod

Guides and Tutorials for libtcodpy should work with the tcod module.

The latest documentation can be found
`here <https://python-tdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

==============
 Installation
==============
The recommended way to install is by using pip.  Older versions of pip will
have issues installing tdl, so make sure it's up-to-date.

Windows / MacOS
---------------
To install using pip, use the following command::

    > python -m pip install tdl

If you get the error "ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could
not be found." when trying to import tcod/tdl then you may need the latest
`Microsoft Visual C runtime
<https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads>`_.

Linux
-----
The easiest method to install tdl on Linux would be from the PPA,
this method will work for the Zesty, Artful, and Bionic versions of Ubuntu::

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:4b796c65/ppa
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install python-tdl python3-tdl

Otherwise tdl will need to be built from source.  Assuming you have Python,
pip, and apt-get, then you'll run these commands to install tdl and its
dependencies to your user environment::

    $ sudo apt-get install gcc python-dev python3-dev libsdl2-dev libffi-dev libomp5
    $ pip2 install tdl
    $ pip3 install tdl

==============
 Requirements
==============
* Python 2.7+, Python 3.4+, or PyPy 5.4+
* Windows, Linux, or MacOS.
* On Linux, requires libsdl2 and libomp5 to run.

 Changelog
===========
Changes relevant for users of the the tdl and tcod packages are documented
here.

This project adheres to `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ since
v2.0.0

------------------
Fixed
 - tdl.event no longer crashes with StopIteration on Python 3.7

5.0.0 - 2018-07-05
------------------
Changed
 - tcod.path: all classes now use `shape` instead of `width` and `height`.
 - tcod.path now respects NumPy array shape, instead of assuming that arrays
   need to be transposed from C memory order.  From now on `x` and `y` mean
   1st and 2nd axis.  This doesn't affect non-NumPy code.
 - tcod.path now has full support of non-contiguous memory.

4.6.1 - 2018-06-30
------------------
Added
 - New function `tcod.line_where` for indexing NumPy arrays using a Bresenham
   line.
Deprecated
 - Python 2.7 support will be dropped in the near future.

4.5.2 - 2018-06-29
------------------
Added
 - New wheels for Python3.7 on Windows.
Fixed
 - Arrays from `tcod.heightmap_new` are now properly zeroed out.

4.5.1 - 2018-06-23
------------------
Deprecated
 - Deprecated all libtcodpy map functions.
Fixed
 - `tcod.map_copy` could break the `tcod.map.Map` class.
 - `tcod.map_clear` `transparent` and `walkable` parameters were reversed.
 - When multiple SDL2 headers were installed, the wrong ones would be used when
   the library is built.
 - Fails to build via pip unless Numpy is installed first.

4.5.0 - 2018-06-12
------------------
Changed
 - Updated libtcod to v1.7.0
 - Updated SDL to v2.0.8
 - Error messages when failing to create an SDL window should be a less vague.
 - You no longer need to initialize libtcod before you can print to an
   off-screen console.
Fixed
 - Avoid crashes if the root console has a character code higher than expected.
Removed
 - No more debug output when loading fonts.

4.4.0 - 2018-05-02
------------------
Added
 - Added the libtcodpy module as an alias for tcod.  Actual use of it is
   deprecated, it exists primarily for backward compatibility.
 - Adding missing libtcodpy functions `console_has_mouse_focus` and
   `console_is_active`.
Changed
 - Updated libtcod to v1.6.6

4.3.2 - 2018-03-18
------------------
Deprecated
 - Deprecated the use of falsy console parameters with libtcodpy functions.
Fixed
 - Fixed libtcodpy image functions not supporting falsy console parameters.
 - Fixed tdl `Window.get_char` method. (Kaczor2704)

4.3.1 - 2018-03-07
------------------
Fixed
 - Fixed cffi.api.FFIError "unsupported expression: expected a simple numeric
   constant" error when building on platforms with an older cffi module and
   newer SDL headers.
 - tcod/tdl Map and Console objects were not saving stride data when pickled.

4.3.0 - 2018-02-01
------------------
Added
 - You can now set the numpy memory order on tcod.console.Console,
   tcod.map.Map, and tdl.map.Map objects well as from the
   tcod.console_init_root function.
Changed
 - The `console_init_root` `title` parameter is now optional.
Fixed
 - OpenGL renderer alpha blending is now consistent with all other render
   modes.

4.2.3 - 2018-01-06
------------------
Fixed
 - Fixed setup.py regression that could prevent building outside of the git
   repository.

4.2.2 - 2018-01-06
------------------
Fixed
 - The Windows dynamic linker will now prefer the bundled version of SDL.
   This fixes:
   "ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found."
 - `key.c` is no longer set when `key.vk == KEY_TEXT`, this fixes a regression
   which was causing events to be heard twice in the libtcod/Python tutorial.

------------------

Changed
 - Added protection to the `transparent`, `walkable`, and `fov`
   attributes in tcod and tdl Map classes, to prevent them from being
   accidentally overridden.

------------------
Changed

- Fixed attribute error in compute_fov

1.5.0 - 2015-07-13
------------------

------------------
- The DLL's have been moved into another library which you can find at
  https://github.com/HexDecimal/libtcod-cffi
  You can use this library to have some raw access to libtcod if you want.
